## Price Prediction Model using Random Forest Regressor

#### ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project implements a price prediction model using the Random Forest Regressor Ensemble Algorithm. The model dynamically adjusts pricing based on the availability of drivers and customer demand, making it suitable for applications like ride-hailing, logistics, or other demand-driven services.

### ðŸ“Œ Current Features

Dynamic Price Adjustment: Predicts prices based on real-time demand and driver availability.

Random Forest Regressor: Uses an ensemble-based approach to improve prediction accuracy.
